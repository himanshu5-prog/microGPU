/**
 * @mainpage Architecture Overview
 * 
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * microGPU is a functional model designed to simulate the execution flow of a modern GPU.
 * The hierarchy follows a standard SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) structure.
 * 
 * @section hierarchy_sec Hardware Hierarchy
 * - **ComputeUnit (CU):** The primary processing block. It contains the logic to execute warps in a round-robin fashion.
 * - **Warp:** A group of threads that execute the same instruction in lock-step.
 * - **Thread:** The smallest unit of execution, containing its own register state and program counter.
 * 
 * @section flow_sec Execution Flow
 * 1. Warps are created in a global collection.
 * 2. The scheduler assigns Warps to an available @ref ComputeUnit.
 * 3. The @ref ComputeUnit cycles through its assigned Warps, advancing their pipeline stages.
