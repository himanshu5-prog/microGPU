 MicroGPU


 I am creating a simple functional model of GPU to understand its architecture. I have started with class definition of thread and warp and later added compute units.

 Currently, microGPU is able to accept warps in global collection and then schedule to computeUnits. 

 TODO:
 Create functionality in compute unit to process the warps and mark it complete and remove it from its own warp collection.

 I will be adding more functionality and update this README.
